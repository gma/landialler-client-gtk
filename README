------

landialler.py is the landialler client program. Along with the
landiallerd.py server (often packaged separately), it enables a group
(or small LAN) of workstations (Windows, Linux, MacOS) to control a
single modem on a Unix server.

landialler is particularly useful if the Unix server is configured to
route packets between the Internet and the workstations (e.g. via IP
Masquerading), providing all the workstations with Internet access
(and control of the modem).
